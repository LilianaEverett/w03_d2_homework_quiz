# CRUD Quiz

Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?
in the file console.rb we create a new instance of the Property class with Property.new

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?
In the file property.rb, when we create the method save to save the instances into a sql table.

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?
property1.delete()

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?
because we shouldn't have access to it to change it. SERIAL8 and PRIMARY KEY will generate automatically a unique id number.

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?
in the line @id = db.exec_prepared("save", values)[0]["id"].to_i
@id is calling the @id in initialize. This one equals the execution of the prepare method on the database, where the first column is the id ([0]["id"]), and we need this value to be an integer (.to_i)

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?
when we're creating an instance, we don't create the id number but in initialize, we're difining a @id. Because we're not passing a value to it (it's generated automatically), it will be an error, so we have to say: if there's id then transform it into an integer.

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?
Because some of the methods affect only 1 instance and others affect all the instances.
hart_road = Property.find(property2.id) This one is a class method because it has to go over all the instances until it finds property2
property1.delete() This one is deleting just 1 instance and we're saying witch one it is

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?
it's a array with a hash inside

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?
To prevent from exterior attacks

## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?
id and address are properties of the class Property

Q11. What are their return values?
it's returning a new instance of the Property class created with a hash with the instance's properties and values, that were returned from database
